# About the author

Christopher I. Macintosh, PhD, RN, is a Solutions Analyst at Intermountain Healthcare and Adjunct Assistant Professor at the University of Utah College of Nursing. I am currently the Interim Team Lead of the Terminology and Modeling Team at Intermountain Healthcare where I help to maintain the Healthcare Data Dictionary (HDD) and map local terms and codes to standardized medical terminologies such as LOINC and SNOMED-CT and create translation mappings between the EMR and other clinical information systems. I'm also adjunct faculty at the University of Utah College of Nursing where I currently teach Statistics for Informatics and Introduction to Computer Science for Clinicians. I previously worked as a scrub and circulating nurse in the operating room and in home health.
